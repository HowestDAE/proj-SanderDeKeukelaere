This URL to a part of the Steam API gives the user a list of all items in Team Fortress 2.
I will use this data to create a tool that displays all items where you can click on each item for additional information such as item slot, item quality, levels, etc.
I think this matches the DAE/GD profile because this tool matches what the inventory does in the actual game.
